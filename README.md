## Orquesta Típica Andariega
(Argentina)

La Orquesta Típica Andariega was created in Buenos Aires September 2009 with the idea of making a new danceable tango based on a solid foundation of classic tango.

The orchestra has a repertoire “bien milonguero” – as we say in Spanish – which means that it is a music intimately connected to the milonga and good for dancing! It is a mix between new arrangements of the most popular tangos, waltz, milongas and new tango compositions that preserve the rhythmic and danceable spirit of the Forties and at the same time add the energy of the new tango movement of the millennium.

## Quinteto Ángel
(Germany)

The Quinteto Ángelm founded in 2001, has quickly become one of the most well known German tango ensembles and regularly inspires concert-goers and tango dancers all over Europe. With extraordinary personal commitment, the five performers play music that draws its intensity from the apparent contradiction between sustained melancholy and impetuous pulsating power. With their interpretations of traditional Argentine tangos and compositions by Tango Nuevo protagonist Astor Piazzolla, they prove that tango is alive and kicking in Europe too.

## Orquesta El Arranque

Founded by double bassist Ignacio Varchausky and bandoneonist Camilo Ferrero and starting off as a quintet, El Arranque developed a repertoire that was readily embraced by the tango community, and by the end of their first year El Arranque had already performed over 200 shows in Argentine theatres and milongas

## Astillero
(Argentina)

Celebrated as the new tango of Buenos Aires on the most prestigious stages of the world, Astillero reflects the passion, rebellion and fury of a city devastated. From the Argentine crisis of 2001 surged this exceptionally beautiful, sensual and yet rabid music that the BBC proclaimed as “The continuation of Piazzolla, absolutely virtuous, crazy and fantastic”.

The sound of Astillero is forceful, vertiginous, breathtaking, raw yet sophisticated: a rollercoaster ride of throbbing accents modulating into earthshattering pianissimos and beyond. Yet this wild sound is entirely hand-made, free of any gimmicks, 100% acoustic: the sound of just wood and strings, brought to searing life by an acute sense for translating the experience of 21st century urban life into new music, built on a solid traditional foundation of Buenos Aires’ tango.

## El Caburé

El grupo intenta seguir la línea de formaciones como el sexteto de los hermanos De Caro o más cercano en el tiempo al Quinteto Real,

## El Cachivache
(Argentina)

El Cachivache is a statement, an electric scream from Buenos Aires, blending tango tradition with the urgency of punk and the pulse of electronica.

Energetic, visceral, and undeniably authentic. They are a reference for the new tango scene with a suburban milonga spirit and contemporary language.

Some call them “modern buffoons”, while others describe their music as “Tango Punk”, and both are true. El Cachivache delivers their music in a vigorous manner with a strong dose of humor, mixing traditional tango with a post-punk look, which simultaneously frightens and attracts the audience.
Witty song introductions emerged with the music, livening up already energetic performances.

## Sexteto Cristal  
(Germany)


Sexteto Cristal keeps the beautiful sound of almost forgotten musical tradition of tango alive. 
The desire of tangueros for the danceable "classics" of all time was the first inspiration and 
horizon of the sextet on the way to create their own style and repertoire.
You can hear the original sound of different orchestras in their interpretation, 
which mirrors the very special melodious phrasing, dramatic articulation and powerful rhythm of the golden age of tango.
Come, listen & dance... pure & refreshing tango argentine for dancing and concert
The ensemble is based in Hamburg and Berlin (Germany) and connected to famous singers and tango musicians all over europe.
